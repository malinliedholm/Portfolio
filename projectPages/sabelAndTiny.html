            Sabel and Tiny is a 2D platform puzzle game developed in Unity as a part of a group project in the course DH2650 Computer Game Design at KTH.
            <br><br>
            During this project it was my first time working in Unity, so I learned the basics of working with the engine. My main contribution to the project was implementing the movement and switching of the characters. I also implemented the puzzle locks which are locks that prevent the characters from reaching different parts of the map. To unlock a lock and progress further in the game the player needs to find the corresponding puzzle piece that is located somewhere on the map. I also had the main responsibility of documenting the work with the game, such as information about gameplay and game mechanics, characters, and game world in a game design document.
